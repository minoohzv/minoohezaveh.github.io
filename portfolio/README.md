Challenges and Overcomes:

1. first I designed a .xd file for my portfolio and I tried to implement it
2. After implementation, I didn't like the layout that I designed on the .xd file. The images were so huge and also the navbar was so thick in comparison to the rest of the page
3. I tried to change the layout on my code and it looked so much better. I updated the xd file based on my implementation.
4. On my homepage I have 4 images for "ILLUSTRATION", "UI/UX DESIGN", "WEB DEVELOPMENT", and "PHOTOGRAPHY". I implemented all these sections on one page called "Portfolio". I wanted by clicking on each name, the link redirects the user to that name section. I learned by adding id and #id to the HTML file, I am able to redirect the user to the specific section of another page. For example: <a href="portfolio.html#photography">PHOTOGRAPHY</a> will redirect the user to portfolio page and PHOTOGRAPHY section.
5. On my portfolio page, I wanted to expand the images that I put from my works. So people could see details better. I found https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css framework that allowed me to add this feature to my images. 
6. I also wanted to add my resume as a pdf file in my contact page which I've never done before. I could add it using href like this: <p>Check my <a href="images/Minoo Hezaveh.pdf">resume</a></p>
7. I learned how to add my email in my contact page that let the other people send me a direct email by clicking on my email address: <a href="mailto:minoohzv@gmail.com">minoohzv@gmail.com</a>
